# yt-dlp-based personal YouTube mp3 extractor

While there are so many variations of online mp3 extractor services out there (a lot of which are riddled with either ads or malwares), I decided utilize the power of open-source libraries and resources, such as yt-dlp.

It only has the service that *I need*.
